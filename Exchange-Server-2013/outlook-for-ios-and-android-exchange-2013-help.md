**Summary:** These articles contain architectural and security information for administrators about Outlook for iOS and Android in an Exchange 2013 on-premises environment.

Outlook for iOS and Android supports two authentication types in Exchange on-premises environments: Basic authentication and hybrid Modern Authentication.

Outlook for iOS and Android uses Basic authentication with Exchange ActiveSync in the following environments:

  - In Exchange Server 2010 environments

  - When a hybrid relationship with Office 365 has not been configured

  - When hybrid Modern Authentication has not been enabled

For more information see [Outlook for iOS and Android](using-basic-authentication-with-outlook-for-ios-and-android-exchange-2013-help.md).

For customers running Exchange Server 2013 or Exchange Server 2016 in a hybrid relationship with Office 365, Outlook for iOS and Android can be configured to leverage hybrid Modern Authentication. For more information, see [ITPro\_R4\_Stub\_80](using-hybrid-modern-authentication-with-outlook-for-ios-and-android-exchange-2013-help.md).
